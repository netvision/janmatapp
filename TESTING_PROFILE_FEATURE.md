# Testing the Profile/Password Change Feature

## How to Test

### 1. Access the Profile Page
1. Log into the admin panel with your credentials
2. Look for your username in the top-right corner
3. Click on the username to open the dropdown menu
4. Click on "Profile Settings"

### 2. Test Password Change Form
1. **View Profile Information**: Verify that your username, user type, email, and name are displayed correctly
2. **Test Form Validation**:
   - Try submitting with empty fields (should show validation errors)
   - Enter mismatched passwords (should show error message)
   - Enter password less than 6 characters (should show error message)
3. **Test Password Strength Indicator**:
   - Type different passwords and watch the strength indicator change
   - Weak: "123456"
   - Fair: "password123"
   - Good: "Password123"
   - Strong: "Password123!"
   - Very Strong: "MySecurePass123!@#"

### 3. Test Backend Integration
**Note**: The backend endpoint needs to be implemented first. See `PASSWORD_CHANGE_IMPLEMENTATION.md`

Once implemented:
1. Enter your current password
2. Enter a new password (min 6 characters)
3. Confirm the new password
4. Click "Change Password"
5. Should see success message if password change is successful

## Expected Behavior

### Success Flow
1. Fill form with valid data
2. Click "Change Password"
3. See loading spinner
4. See green success message
5. Form clears automatically

### Error Flow
1. Enter incorrect current password
2. Click "Change Password"
3. See red error message: "Current password is incorrect"

### Validation Errors
- Empty fields: Browser validation prevents submission
- Password mismatch: "New passwords do not match"
- Short password: "New password must be at least 6 characters long"
